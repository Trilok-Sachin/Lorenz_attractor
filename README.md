# Lorenz Attractor
Julia and Python versions to simulate the Lorenz attractor Differential Equations

1) Julia notebook using DifferentialEquations package to solve for Lorenz Attractor 
equations to model convection
2) Python script to animate Lorenz attractors with different initial conditions to 
illustrate how small changes amount to significantly different visual patterns
